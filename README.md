# Copy Trading Platform

## overview
A **copy trading platform** allows users to automatically replicate the trades of experienced traders in real time. It bridges the gap between skilled traders (often called "signal providers" or "leaders") and followers (those who copy their trades), enabling passive investing while leveraging expert strategies.

A multi-platform copy trading ecosystem that connects Master Traders (experienced strategists) with Copiers (investors) across multiple trading platforms (MT4, MT5, Tradelocker, cTrader, etc.). Unlike competitors, this platform supports cross-platform copy trading, enabling users to follow traders regardless of their preferred brokerage software.
